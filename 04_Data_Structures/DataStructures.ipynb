    "### Mutability vs. Immutability\n",
    "In Python, understanding the difference between mutable and immutable data structures is crucial. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after the list is created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order\n",
    "Both lists and tuples are ordered collections, which means the items have a defined order, and that order will not change. Sets, however, are unordered collections, so the items do not have a defined order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duplicates\n",
    "Sets do not allow duplicate elements. This means that every element in a set must be unique. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keys in Dictionaries\n",
    "In dictionaries, keys must be unique and immutable. This means that you cannot have two identical keys in a dictionary, and the keys must be of a type that cannot be changed, such as strings or numbers."
